Abstract
========

Most of todayâ€™s digital design is done in HDL code (mostly Verilog or
VHDL) and with the help of HDL synthesis tools.

In special cases such as synthesis for coarse-grain cell libraries or
when testing new synthesis algorithms it might be necessary to write a
custom HDL synthesis tool or add new features to an existing one. In
these cases the availability of a Free and Open Source (FOSS) synthesis
tool that can be used as basis for custom tools would be helpful.

In the absence of such a tool, the Yosys Open SYnthesis Suite (Yosys)
was developed. This document covers the design and implementation of
this tool. At the moment the main focus of Yosys lies on the high-level
aspects of digital synthesis. The pre-existing FOSS logic-synthesis tool
ABC is used by Yosys to perform advanced gate-level optimizations.

An evaluation of Yosys based on real-world designs is included. It is
shown that Yosys can be used as-is to synthesize such designs. The
results produced by Yosys in this tests where successfully verified
using formal verification and are comparable in quality to the results
produced by a commercial synthesis tool.

This document was originally published as bachelor thesis at the Vienna
University of Technology :raw-latex:`\cite{BACC}`.
